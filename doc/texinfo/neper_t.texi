@chapter Tessellation Module (-T)

@MT{} generates @dfn{tessellations} and @dfn{multiscale tessellations}
of a bounded @dfn{domain} of space, in 2D or 3D.  Periodicity and
semi-periodicity conditions can be prescribed.  @MT{} also enables to
@dfn{regularize} the tessellations for better-quality meshing. The
tessellations are provided in scalar (vectorial) or raster formats.
@MT{} also generates crystal orientations for the tessellation cells.

@dfn{Tessellations} can be generated from various types of
morphological cell properties (option @option{-morpho}).  Several
predefined properties are available, such as those obtained by grain
growth in metals (which are described by cell size and sphericity
distributions). Custom properties can be specified using various
metrics, including the size, the sphericity, the centroid
or even the actual shape (using a raster tessellation), in terms
of either distributions (when applicable) or individual cell values.
Global morphological properties, such as a cell aspect ratio or a
columnar axis, can also be specified.
The generated @dfn{tessellations} are Laguerre (or Voronoi)
tessellations whose seed attributes are set by optimization to
obtain the desired cell properties.  Of course, it is also possible to
generate standard tessellations (e.g.@ Poisson-Voronoi or regular
tessellations).

@dfn{Multiscale tessellations} are characterized by the subdivision of
the cells of a primary tessellation into secondary tessellations (and so
on) and are obtained by combining into one, using the
@w{@samp{@SEPFRAC{}} separator}, the option arguments that apply at the
successive scales.  The same value can be used for defining the
tessellations at a given scale, or different values can be loaded from a
@dfn{multiscale cell file} (@pxref{Multiscale Cell File}).  So, all
capabilities available for generating a standard (single-scale)
tessellations are available for generating the tessellations at the
different scales of a multiscale tessellation.  Examples are provided in
the following.

The @dfn{domain} of space in which the tessellation is created can be of
any convex shape. In 3D, cuboidal, cylindrical and spherical shapes (and a few
other, exotic shapes) are directly supported while other morphologies can
be defined from a set of planes (@w{option @option{-domain}}).  Periodicity or
semi-periodicity conditions can be applied to the tessellation (@w{option
    @option{-periodicity}}).

@dfn{Crystal orientations} can be randomly distributed (according to a
uniform frequency distribution), either in the 3D space or along a specific
orientation fibre, or uniformly distributed (option @option{-ori}).
Uniform crystal orientation distributions ensure that all possible
crystal orientations are equally represented (no orientation clustering).
Crystal orientations can be provided according to different descriptors (option
@option{-oridescriptor}).

@dfn{Regularization} can be applied to the tessellations and consists in
removing their small edges and faces (option @option{-regularization})
which would otherwise be detrimental to good-quality meshing with
@mM{} (@pxref{Meshing Module (-M)}).  It it not available for periodic
tessellations yet.

@dfn{Output files} describe the tessellation either at the scalar
format @file{.tess} or at the raster format @file{.tesr} (@pxref{File
Formats}).  Both are input files of @mM{} (@pxref{Meshing Module (-M)})
and @mV{} (@pxref{Visualization Module (-V)}).  Third-party software
file formats are also available.

@subsection Morphology Options

These options can be used to set the cell morphology.  If you want to
set seeds attributes instead, use @samp{@option{-morphooptiini ...
  -morpho voronoi}}.

@opt{-morpho, char_string,
Specify morphological properties of the cells.
It can be done either by using a special morphology string (as defined
below)@comma{} or by specifying custom cell properties such as sizes@comma{}
sphericities@comma{} centroids@comma{} or even exact shapes (using a raster
tessellation). Global properties (sometimes refered to as @dfn{morphological
texture}) can be added.  Finally@comma{} in the case of a multiscale
tessellation@comma{} cell-by-cell values can be specified using
@code{@var{file_name}}@comma{} where @code{@var{file_name}} is the name of a
multiscale cell file containing the list of morphologies (see @ref{Multiscale
Cell File}).
@*
@emph{(i)} The special morphology strings are the following (mutually-exclusive):@*
@bullet{} @samp{@code{voronoi}} for a standard Poisson-Voronoi
tessellation;@*
@bullet{} @samp{@code{graingrowth}} or @samp{@code{gg}} for
grain-growth statistical properties@comma{} which correspond to a wider grain size
distribution and higher grain sphericities than in a Voronoi tessellation
(it actually is an alias for
@samp{@code{diameq:lognormal(1,0.35),sphericity:lognormal(0.145,0.03,1-x)}}@comma{}
@w{see below}); the @samp{@code{graingrowth(@var{mean})}} and
@samp{@code{gg}(@var{mean})} variants can be used to provide an absolute
mean grain size@comma{} @code{@var{mean}} (in which case @option{-n
from_morpho} must be used@comma{} see below);@*
@bullet{} @samp{@code{centroidal}} for a centroidal
tessellation@footnote{@code{centroidal} is not recommended as it does
not correspond to a morphological property @i{per se}; size and/or
sphericity properties should be used instead.}
(it actually is an alias for @samp{@code{centroid:seed}}@comma{} @w{see
below});@*
@bullet{} @samp{cube(@var{N})} / @samp{square(@var{N})} for a regular
tessellation into cubic / square cells@comma{}
where @samp{@var{N}} is the number of cells along a direction@comma{}
or @samp{cube(@var{N1@SEPNODEP{}N2@SEPNODEP{}N3})} /
@samp{square(@var{N1@SEPNODEP{}N2})} for a regular tessellation into
cubic / square cells@comma{} where @samp{@var{N1}}@comma{} @samp{@var{N2}}
and @samp{@var{N3}} are the number of cells along the different
directions;@*
@bullet{} @samp{tocta(@var{N})} for a regular
tessellation into truncated octahedra@comma{}
where @samp{@var{N}} is the number of cells along a direction;@*
@bullet{} @samp{lamellar(w=@var{w}@comma{}v=@var{v}@comma{}pos=@var{pos})} for a lamellar
morphology.  Argument @samp{w=@var{w}} is mandatory@comma{} and arguments
@samp{v=@var{v}} and @samp{pos=@var{pos}} are optional.
Argument @samp{@code{w=@var{w}}} enables
to specify the absolute lamella width @code{@var{w}}.  For specifying
several widths@comma{} combine them @w{with @samp{@SEPDEP}}.  In the
case of a multiscale tessellation@comma{} for specifying cell-by-cell
width values@comma{} use the syntax @samp{file(@var{file_name})} where
@code{@var{file_name}} is the name of a multiscale cell file containing
the list of widths (see @ref{Multiscale Cell File}).  Argument
@samp{@code{v=@var{v}}} enables to specify the lamella plane @w{normals
@code{@var{v}}}.  For randomly-distributed normals taken from a uniform
distribution@comma{} use @samp{random} (the default).  For a direction of space@comma{} use
@samp{(@var{dir_x}@comma{}@var{dir_y}@comma{}@var{dir_z})}@comma{}
where @math{(@var{dir_x}@comma{}@var{dir_y}@comma{}@var{dir_z})} is the
direction.
For a direction of the parent
crystal@comma{} use
@samp{crysdir(@var{crysdir_x}@comma{}@var{crysdir_y}@comma{}@var{crysdir_z})}@comma{}
where @math{(@var{crysdir_x}@comma{}@var{crysdir_y}@comma{}@var{crysdir_z})} is the
  crystal direction.
For specifying cell-by-cell
normals@comma{} use the syntax @samp{file(@var{file_name})} where
@code{@var{file_name}} is the name of a multiscale cell file containing
the list of lamella plane normals (see @ref{Multiscale Cell File}).
Argument @samp{@code{pos=@var{pos}}} enables
to specify the position of the lamellaes@comma{} @code{@var{pos}}.
It can be @samp{@var{random}} for a random position (the default) or
@samp{@var{start}} for the first lamella starting (full-width) from the
start point of the domain (along direction @code{@var{dir}}).
In the
case of a multiscale tessellation@comma{} for specifying cell-by-cell
position values@comma{} use the syntax @samp{file(@var{file_name})} where
@code{@var{file_name}} is the name of a multiscale cell file containing
the list of positions (see @ref{Multiscale Cell File}).@*
@emph{(ii)} Custom morphological properties can be defined
by providing as argument the cell
property and its value@comma{} combined with the @samp{@SEPDEP{}} separator.
The available properties are the following:@*
@bullet{} @samp{@code{size}} for the size (volume in 3D and area in 2D)
and @samp{@code{diameq}} for the equivalent diameter;@*
@bullet{} @samp{@code{sphericity}} for the sphericity;@*
@bullet{} @samp{@code{centroid}} for the centroid;@*
@bullet{} @samp{@code{centroidtol}} for the centroid with a tolerance ---
centroids with a tolerance higher than 1000 times the minimum tolerance are
disregarded;@*
@bullet{} @samp{@code{centroidsize}} for combined centroid and size@comma{}
and @samp{@code{centroiddiameq}} for combined centroid and equivalent
diameter;@*
@bullet{} @samp{@code{tesr}} for cells of a raster tessellation.@*
Sizes@comma{} diameqs and sphericities can be defined by statistical
distributions or on a per-cell basis@comma{} while centroids can be
defined only on a per-cell basis.
The statistical distributions can be: a
Dirac distribution@comma{} @samp{dirac(@var{mean})}@comma{} a
normal distribution@comma{} @samp{normal(@var{mean},@var{sig})}@comma{}
lognormal distributions@comma{}
@samp{lognormal(@var{mean},@var{sig})} or
@samp{lognormal(@var{mean},@var{sig},1-x)} (which means the variable is
(1 @math{-} the cell property))@comma{} or a sum of
distributions of increasing averages@comma{} for example@comma{}
@samp{0.3*normal(@var{mean1},@var{sig1})+0.7*normal(@var{mean2},@var{sig2})}.
@samp{@code{mean}} represents the mean and
@samp{@code{sig}} represents the standard deviation.
If the number of cells is defined (see option @option{-n})@comma{} the
size or diameq distribution is scaled to get the specified number
of cells; otherwise@comma{} i.e.@ @option{-n} is set to @samp{from_morpho}@comma{} the number
of cells is determined from the size or diameq distribution.
An interval of possible values can also be provided using
@samp{interval(@var{min}@comma{}@var{max})}.
A unique value can be assigned to all cells using @samp{@var{value}}@comma{}
where @samp{@var{value}} is the value.
Cell-by-cell values can be provided using
@samp{file(@var{file_name})}@comma{} where @samp{@var{file_name}} is
the name of the file containing the cell values (@pxref{Position File}
for @samp{@code{centroid}}; add a tolerance to each position for @samp{@code{centroidtol}}).
For @samp{@code{centroid}}@comma{} provide @samp{seed} to get a
centroidal tessellation.
For @samp{@code{tesr}}@comma{} @samp{@var{file_name}} is the name of the
raster tessellation file. If @option{-n} is set to
@samp{from_morpho}@comma{} the number of cells is set to the number of
cells of the raster tessellation.
@*
@emph{(iii)} The global cell properties are the following (mutually-exclusive):
@*
@bullet{} @samp{@code{columnar(@var{dir})}} for a columnar morphology along
coordinate axis @samp{@var{dir}}@comma{} where @samp{@var{dir}} can be
@samp{@code{x}}@comma{} @samp{@code{y}} or @samp{@code{z}};
@*

coordinate axis @samp{@var{dir}}@comma{} where @samp{@var{dir}} can be
@samp{@code{x}}@comma{} @samp{@code{y}} or @samp{@code{z}};
@*
@bullet{} @samp{@code{aspratio(@var{r1}@comma{}@var{r2}@comma{}@var{r3})}}@comma{}
where @samp{@var{r1}}@comma{} @samp{@var{r1}} and @samp{@var{r3}} represents
relative length along the coordinate axes. For a 2D tessellation@comma{}
@samp{@var{r3}} can be omitted.  When provided@comma{} other
properties@comma{} such as the equivalent diameter or the sphericity@comma{}
are considered to apply to the cells as if they had no aspect ratio.
@*
To specify several properties@comma{} combine them @w{with @samp{@SEPNODEP}}
(centroids and sizes/equivalent diameters should be seen as one
 property and specified with @code{centroidsize}/@code{centroiddiameq}).

@samp{@var{weight_char_string}} are available@comma{} depending on the value of
option @option{-morpho}:@*
@bullet{} @samp{@var{weight_char_string}} can be a real value@comma{} any

values@comma{} @samp{@code{avradeq}} and @samp{@code{avdiameq}}@comma{}
respectively@comma{}
